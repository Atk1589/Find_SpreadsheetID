How to Find Your Google Spreadsheet ID

If you're using a Google Spreadsheet and need to locate your Spreadsheet ID for applications like "Spreadsheet Connector" or other integrations, follow these simple steps:

Open your Google Spreadsheet in your web browser.

Look at the URL in your browser's address bar. It should look something like this:

bash
Copy code
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2b3C4D5E6F7G8H9I10J11K12L13M14NOP15Q/edit
The Spreadsheet ID is the long string of letters and numbers between /d/ and /edit in the URL. In the example above, the Spreadsheet ID would be:

Copy code
1A2b3C4D5E6F7G8H9I10J11K12L13M14NOP15Q
Copy the Spreadsheet ID and use it wherever required.

Now you're all set to use your Spreadsheet ID!
